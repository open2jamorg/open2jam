Health Points
=============

This observation is based on O2Mania version 1.3.0.

Good judgment does not affect health points in all difficulties.

Easy Difficulty
---------------

* Miss : -6%
* Bad : -1%
* Cool : +0.4%

Normal Difficulty
-----------------

* Miss : -4%
* Bad : -2/3%
* Cool : +8/3%

Hard Difficulty
---------------

* Miss : -3%
* Bad : -0.5%
* Cool : 0.1%


Generalization
==============

Therefore, if the health are only integers, the above could be generalized like this:

Maximum health:

* Easy: 12000 * 2 = 24000 points
* Normal: 12000 * 3 = 36000 points
* Hard: 12000 * 4 = 48000 points

Health gaining and draining:

* Miss: -720 points
* Bad: -120 points
* Cool: 48 points for easy and normal, 24 points for hard
